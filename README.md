# About The Project

Throughout my university coursework, I embarked on a minor project within the Java course, specifically emphasizing units and integration tests. This undertaking involved the development of a system that computes prices and generates invoices for a small-scale film distributor. Comprehensive units and integration tests were implemented to ensure the functionality and reliability of the project.
